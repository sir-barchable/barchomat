**Sir Barchable's Clash of Clans Server**

## What?

This is a little program that sits between your game of Clash and the server at Supercell, and watches the messages
that pass between them. It can also emulate the Supercell server, allowing you to experiment with layouts and attack
strategies while off-line.

## Why?

Supercell doesn't provide an easy way for clan leaders to collect clan and enemy stats. If you want to track the 
performance of the 40+ players in your clan the paper and pencil approach is tedious. 

## What can it do?

It runs in two modes—proxy mode, and server mode. In proxy mode it monitors a real game session, collects statistics, 
and saves village layouts that you scout. In server mode it allows you to edit and attack the villages layouts that 
you've collected. We're working on player stat collection and collation. Things will progress faster if you help out.    

## Do I have root my device/install your dodgy hack?

No, this is a completely separate program. No mods are required.

## Will I get banned for using this?

No, the proxy doesn't modify the traffic in any way. All it does is monitor the conversation that you're having with 
Supercell, so there's no way of telling that it's in use. When using the server no communication with Supercell happens
at all.

## OK, how do I make it go?

To run the proxy you'll need Java 8, a copy of the proxy, and a copy of the game. Download barchomat 
[here][3]. The proxy reads game logic (hit points, dps etc for the various characters and buildings) from 
the android version of executable, which you'll need to find yourself (Google "clash of clans apk"). Put the proxy and 
the game executable in the same directory and start the proxy from the command line:

    java -jar barchomat.jar proxy
    
The proxy will log a startup message if all is well:
    
    10:06:59 INFO  Reading protocol definition from Protocol.json
    10:07:00 DEBUG Reading logic from com.supercell.clashofclans-7.65-Android-4.0.3.apk
    10:07:00 INFO  Listening on 9339  

The second part is harder; you have to convince your device to talk to the proxy rather than the real Clash server. 
The easiest way of doing this is changing the DNS entries for `game.clashofclans.com` and `gamea.clansofclans.com` 
to point to the machine you're running the proxy on. If you're playing on a phone or tablet this will typically mean 
connecting through WiFi and changing the entries for the LAN.  

You probably won't want to redirect all Clash traffic on your LAN to the proxy—that would interfere with your day to 
day clashing. Instead, run a local DNS (I use [dnsmasq][1]) and set your device to use it. There are a few ways set 
your game up to use an alternate DNS:

 - Alter the DNS settings on the device directly
 - Play the game in an emulator on a machine set to use the alternate DNS
 - Share the connection of a machine set to use the alternate DNS with your device over WiFi 

Make sure that the firewall on the proxy machine allows connections to port 9339, then fire up your game. You should
see the connection logged in your console:

    10:39:07 INFO  Client connected from /192.168.1.2
    10:39:08 INFO  Sir Barchable
    10:39:08 INFO  DPS: 344, HP: 27065 (walls 138000)
    10:39:08 INFO  Garrison: [lvl 3 Healer x 1]
    10:39:08 INFO  Town Hall: Loot[g=1000, e=1000, de=0]
    10:39:08 INFO  Storage: Loot[g=70967, e=226135, de=0]
    10:39:08 INFO  Castle: Loot[g=0, e=0, de=0]
    10:39:08 INFO  Collectors: Loot[g=6976, e=8651, de=0]
    10:39:08 INFO  Total: Loot[g=78943, e=235786, de=0]
    
If you don't see any output from the proxy, and your game runs fine, it's likely that the device is not picking up the 
alternate DNS entries. If your game freezes or displays an error there's a problem with the connection between the 
device and the proxy.  

## Server mode

Server mode is very basic at the moment, it only emulates attacks. Before running in server mode, run the proxy for a 
bit and collect some village snapshots. To start the app in server mode use the command:

    java -jar barchomat.jar server
    
When you attack you'll be presented with the villages you collected while in proxy mode. While in server mode the
changes you make to your village won't be sent to Supercell; the next time you connect to the real server you'll get 
your old village back.

Don't worry about matching up your real-life settings by playing on the server. The game doesn't save state on your 
device, so there's no way to permanently alter your village without a connection to Supercell. Every time you connect 
your device loads fresh copy from the server. **However**, this doesn't apply to your connection with the 
AppStore/Google Play. Any gems you buy are real.

## This is crap, and I want to help make it better to play clash of clan
  
If you know Java, fork the code and start hacking from the outside (ClashProxy.java), or the inside 
(VillageAnalyzer.java). There are some brief [build instructions][5] in the top level directory. 

If anything useful comes of it mail me at *sir.barchable@gmail.com*. 

If you're handy with stream capture tools like [tcpflow][2] you can help out with protocol analysis.
We've described the protocol packet structure in a collection of [JSON files][4], so no programming 
is required.
